h1. Organize your Objective-C code in Xcode with #pragma mark

As I didn't know it, @CTRL+MAJ+2@ command opens a contextual popin listing your file's methods.

While coding, it can be a mess quickly in this list. This is where mark saves your life.

Xcode gives you a *pragma mark* metatag you can use in two ways:

First:

bc. #pragma mark -

adds a separator (as @<hr/>@ html tag) in the contextual list.

Second:

bc. #pragma mark Your great not to long description

gathers methods in a group named _Your great not to long description_.

This two uses of Pragma mark allow you to visualy organise your code.
