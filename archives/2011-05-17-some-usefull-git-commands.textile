- @git submodule update --init [--recursive]@ := Update and/or install all submodules (recursively)
- @git push origin :branch-or-tag-name@ := Delete remote branch or tag
- @git log origin/master ^master@ := Show diff beetween remote and local branch
- @git br --contains commit@ := Show in which branch is contained a commit (thx MarcW)
- @git push origin commit:master@ := Push master to origin remote until a commit
- @git co my_file.txt --theirs/--ours@ := In a merge with conflict, checkout local branch (ours) or other branch (theirs) file version
