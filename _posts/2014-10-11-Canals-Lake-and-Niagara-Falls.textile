Last Thanksgiving long week, C, I and our tandem bicycle went to Niagara Falls region to cycle along the Welland Canals parkway trail and the Niagara River recreation trail.

I found the route in:

Some notes:

* The Welland canals parkway trail, from St Catharines to Welland (and farther) is a broad, mostly flat asphalt path.
* The Niagara River recreation trail, between Niagara Falls, ON and Niagara-on-the-Lake is mostly downhill. Way easier to cycle it that way.
