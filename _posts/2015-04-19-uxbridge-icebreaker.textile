Well, I think we were two or three idiots on cyclocross bike to ride the two 15km loops of mostly dry single tracks of the Uxbridge Icebreaker 2015.

Though, it was a lot of fun, as this picture shows:

I finished in honorable 13th place (out of 16) in my age category (newly 30-39) in 2h and 7min (43min after 1st place).
