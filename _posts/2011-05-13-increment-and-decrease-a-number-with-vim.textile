h1. Increment and decrement number with vim

As you already know, *vim*[1], it's great!

To simply increment and decrement a number, you just have to put your
cursor on the right number and press @CTRL+A@ to increment or @CTRL+X@ to decrement.

You can suffix this command with a number to change the step.

The "official documentation":http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/change.html#CTRL-A.

fn1. Vi IMproved, it's "a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing". See "about page":http://www.vim.org/about.php
